"""Module for information-theoretic and pseudorandom threshold secret sharing.

Threshold secret sharing assumes secure channels for communication.
Pseudorandom secret sharing (PRSS) allows one to share pseudorandom
secrets without any communication, as long as the parties
agree on a (unique) common public input for each secret.

PRSS relies on parties having agreed upon the keys for a pseudorandom
